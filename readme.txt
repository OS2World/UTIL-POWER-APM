 APM                             Version 0.01ß    Last revised: 27-04-98

This is a tool for exploring the Power Management features of modern BIOS's. APM lets you interactively check out APM functionality, set power states, monitor batteries, etc etc. Comes complete with full Turbo Pascal source code. Great for sorting out motherboards that crash whenever APM kicks in, and other APM related bugs. Even runs under Win95!
